# Nxmbers
## Not naming this version because there's no point. It's probably 7 or 8. It doesn't matter.

A more polished and streamlined version of _nxmbers, by MXCHINES. Drafted specifically for prototyping/trialing functionality.

find _nxmbers here <a href="https://github.com/mxchines/_nxmbers.git>github/mxchines/nxmbers</a> 
(doesn't work either. I'll probably finish it by the end of 2025)
